						One of the tasking responsibilities of businesses in this digital
						age is transcending the noise and communicating their brand essence
						in a way that captures consumer attention and converts those
						attention into desirable actions for the business.
						<br />
						<br />A recent study by Microsoft Corp reveals that the average
						attention span of a human is about 8 seconds and several brands are
						already competing for this time. What makes you stand out each time
						is a compelling brand message that prospects can identify with, a
						huge part of why storytelling matters. <br />
						<br />
						There is no stronger connection between humans than storytelling.
						People want to interact with brands that see them, understand their
						needs and reflect their values â€“ No better way to compel action and
						drive behavior than infusing storytelling into your digital
						marketing campaigns.
